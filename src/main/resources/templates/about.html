    <p>Recycling A to Z is an application that provides guidance on the recycling methods of items when you take a photo of them. Established in 2023 for public welfare, the application strives to enhance people's awareness of recycling and provide greater convenience. With a diverse population of immigrants in Ireland, each country having different recycling methods, the app aims to reduce the inconvenience of searching for recycling methods every time. Additionally, it suggests ways to protect the environment and increase recycling rates with just one photo.</p>
    <br>
      <p>In Ireland, while it is common to dispose of bottles in glass banks, the app alleviates the inconvenience of having to search for glass bank locations every time whenever you move in. Moreover, it reduces the hassle of searching for battery recycling locations, as they are designated. Future campaigns focus on improving people's awareness and increasing recycling rates.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Furthermore, if users encounter ambiguous or unclear search results while using the app, they can utilize the community to ask questions and receive answers from other users. The community also allows users to share information, such as whether glass banks are full, providing assistance to fellow users.</p>
